# 🧠 Credit Card Advisor System (India)

A smart, personalized credit card recommendation system that helps Indian users discover the most rewarding credit cards based on their income, spending habits, and lifestyle preferences.

This project uses a multi-step guided form and a rule-based recommendation engine (with optional OpenAI integration) to simulate how a real financial assistant would help you choose between dozens of available cards.
